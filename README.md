# CalHacks Project - Repository Now Private
🚀 **Project Status**: This project was originally developed for CalHacks, but it has now been made private. As we move toward potentially launching this as a real product, we have decided to temporarily remove public access to the repository. 🛠️

🔒 **Repository Access**: The repository is currently empty, as we are actively working on making significant updates and improvements behind the scenes. We look forward to sharing the project publicly once it's ready for release. 👀

📅 **Future Updates**: Stay tuned! As we finalize the development process, more information will be made available regarding the release and public access to this repository. 🎉

Feel free to reach out for any inquiries!
